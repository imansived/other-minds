"""Generate a corpus of real agent turns to run the analytics over.

The divergence metrics measure whether the three agents actually think
differently. That question cannot be answered from a handful of turns, and it
must not be answered from invented text — fake transcripts would tell us
about the fixture, not about the prompts. So this drives the real agents,
through the real orchestrator, and stores the result in the real database.

Conversations are given deterministic `seed-NNNN` ids so a re-run replaces them
rather than piling up duplicates, and so seeded rows are easy to tell apart
from anything you produced by using the app.
