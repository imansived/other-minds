"""The Introspector may propose a reading. It may not promote one into a fact.

Every case here is a PAIR built on the same words. If a test could be passed by
deleting a phrase from the prompts, it would be testing vocabulary; these are
built so the offending phrase appears on both sides and only the epistemic
status differs. That is the behaviour being protected:

    observation → interpretation → uncertainty

The bad examples are the shapes named in review, plus two taken verbatim from
generated transcripts.
