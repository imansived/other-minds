"""HTTP contract for the conversation endpoints.

Most of these use FastAPI's TestClient and make no model calls — the
conversation routes are sync `def` handlers over sqlite. /agent/turn is async
and TestClient gives each request its own event loop, which the REAL cached
LLM client does not survive — that path (an actual model call) is covered end
to end against a real server instead, never here. What CAN run here, and does
(see the provider-error and build-stamp tests below), is /agent/turn with
`main.generate_turn` itself patched out, so the request never reaches the
client that cannot survive the event loop. That is still real coverage of the
route's own logic — status mapping, error shape, telemetry — it just is not a
real generation.

The 404 shape matters more than it looks: the UI distinguishes "this
conversation is gone" from "the service is unreachable" by status code, and
drops a stale sidebar row only on a 404.
