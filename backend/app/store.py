"""SQLite persistence.

Replaces the browser's localStorage as the home for conversation history, and
adds the thing localStorage could never give us: a queryable corpus of turns to
run the divergence analytics over.

Two independent write paths, deliberately not entangled:

  conversations + messages  the user's history. Mirrored from the client on
                            every change, full-replace, exactly as it was
                            mirrored into localStorage before.
  generations               append-only telemetry, written by /agent/turn.
                            Never rewritten, so it survives the full-replace
                            above and keeps an honest record of every call.

Messages are stored one row per turn rather than as a JSON blob, so pandas can
read the corpus directly with a plain SELECT.

Uses stdlib sqlite3: no ORM, because the schema is three flat tables and an
ORM's value here would be negative. pandas.read_sql works against these
connections as-is.
