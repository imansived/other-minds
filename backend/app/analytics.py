"""Do the three agents actually think differently?

That is the entire premise of the app, and until now there was no way to check
it except by reading. This module answers it from the stored corpus.

The headline metric is **separability**: train a classifier to guess which agent
wrote a turn, from the turn's text alone. If it cannot do better than chance,
the three prompts are producing one voice in three costumes, and no amount of
reading a few transcripts would reliably tell you that.

Everything here reads; nothing here writes. It is safe to run against the live
