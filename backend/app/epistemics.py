"""Does a claim about someone's inner life admit that it is a claim?

The Introspector's whole value is reading what a person has not said outright.
Its whole failure mode is promoting that reading into a fact because it sounded
psychologically plausible — and plausibility is not evidence. A well-made
sentence is the easiest thing in the world to mistake for a true one:

    "You already know you want to leave."
    "The fear of resenting them is already a form of resentment."

Neither is checkable, and both are stated as established. The fix is not to ban
the sentence. It is to require the third beat:

    observation → interpretation → uncertainty

    "You keep returning to the idea of leaving. I wonder if part of you has
     already made the decision, while another part is afraid of what follows."

Same reading, same sharpness, honest about its own standing. So this module
does not look for phrases — it looks for a claim about an inner state that
carries no marker saying whose claim it is. The identical phrase passes or fails
depending on whether the marker is there, which is the behaviour being
protected rather than the vocabulary.

No pandas here on purpose: analytics.py imports this for the corpus metric, and
the live scenario harness imports it too, where a dataframe stack would be dead
weight.
