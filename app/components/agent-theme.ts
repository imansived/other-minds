  // y 419→759; the shoulder line reaches full width at y 779; the dark window
  // frame starts at x 853 and the crop stops short of it. The disc takes a
  // 720px square centred at (480, 600) — head across 45% of the width, which
  // leaves the sunlit wall and the shadow line falling across it in frame

  // point of the picture is the walking, so this is framed on the figure in
  // the street rather than cropped to a head. His right-hand profile is the
  // clean edge to measure against: hair from y 300, widest at x 622 by y 360,
  // pinching to 598 at the neck (y 420), shoulders opening again from y 435;
  // body and pack at their widest run x 405→694 around y 615. His left side
  // is not measurable — it merges into the dark doorway behind him, which is
  // also why he needs the lit path to read at all: he sits at luminance 15
  // against a path at 150, and that gap is what survives being 32px wide. The
  // disc takes a 900px square centred at (700, 600) — offset well right of him
  // on purpose, so he sits in the left third of the circle and the lit street
  // he is walking down occupies the rest of it. Centring him would have made
  // it a portrait of a man; this keeps it a picture of someone out in the
  // world, walking. Over 100%, so no fill.

  // band. What separates them is greenness, G - max(R, B), which the foliage
  // runs positive on and his hair and shirt do not. Masked that way the head
  // measures x 500→735, y 130→380; his lit hands on the pot are the brightest
  // thing low in the frame, at (797, 629). The disc takes a 780px square
  // centred at (695, 460), which holds head, hands and pot together with him
  // at 40% across — the plants and the window take the rest. Over 100%, so no
